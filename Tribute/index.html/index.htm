<p>
				☛Walter Payton was a complete football player. He could run, block, throw, catch — hell, 
                                                                    he was Boobie 
                                  Miles at the pro level. The lyrics really say it all, Walter, baby you’re the best.

				☛He had every tool in the tool kit. He would juke you out of your shoes or 
                             stutter-step a defender complete, ruining all pursuit angles. 
                                   Walter Payton could stiff-arm you to next week.<br><br>
				
                               ☛ Payton was one of three children born to Peter and Alyne Payton in Columbia, Mississippi. 
                                 His father was a factory worker who had played semi-professional baseball. 
                  Payton was an active member of the Boy Scouts, Little League, and his local church. At John J. Jefferson High School,
                   Payton played drums in the marching band, participated in the track team and sang in the school choir.<br><br>
				
                                      ☛ . Payton first began to attract national attention as a halfback at Jackson State University,
                                 making the starting lineup his freshman year in 1971. He was selected for the All-American team.
				<br><br> 
                                
                                        ☛He was described by his coach Mike Ditka as one of the greatest football players
                                                            he had ever seen <strong>“sweetness.”</strong><br><br> 

             ☛Though Payton’s performance was good in the 1978 season with 1,395 yards, the team’s overall performance 
                                         declined under the new coach Neill Armstrong. 
                The team’s performance didn’t improve much the following year either, as Payton was injured most of
 the season with cracked ribs as well as sore shoulders. He slipped to 1,222 yards, and failed to win the NFC.
            The Bears continued to struggle over the next few years. They then hired Mike Ditka as the new head coach. 
The team performed averagely in the 1982 and 1983 seasons.

    ☛ The late Walter Payton, whom many regard as the best running back in league history,
                  is the subject of a new biography by Jeff Pearlman.  
And Pearlman claims in the book that, after retiring from pro football, Payton abused drugs.
				<br><br> 

              ☛ Payton, who retired after the 1987 season as the then-all-time leading rusher in NFL history, 
was depressed and suicidal in the mid-1990s. Pearlman cites a letter from Payton to a friend, 
in which Payton said he imagined himself killing those around him and then turning a gun on himself.
				<br><br> 

                                 ☛ Famous for his speed and power running style, he was also famous for his charitable work.
                      Him and his wife created the Walter Payton Foundation in 1988, 
                                   to help the needy children in the streets of Chicago.

                                         ☛The Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year goes out to an outstanding player and humanitarian each year. 
                    Due to Payton being one of the best humanitarians of NFL history, he got the NFL
                                           Man of the Year award renamed based on his name.
